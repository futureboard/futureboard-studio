//! Windowless (off-screen) CEF rendering for built-in plugin editors.
//!
//! Windows uses `OnAcceleratedPaint`: CEF exposes a callback-scoped D3D11 shared
//! texture which the host copies directly into GPUI-owned GPU memory. This
//! avoids CPU readback, per-frame image allocation, and atlas churn. Linux,
//! macOS, and Windows fallback use [`ImplRenderHandler::on_paint`]; the host
//! uploads that BGRA framebuffer as a texture and feeds input back in with
//! `send_*_event`.
//!
//! ## Threading
//!
//! `on_paint` runs on CEF's UI thread, which is the same thread that drives
//! `do_message_loop_work` — i.e. the GPUI UI thread. The `Mutex` here is
//! therefore effectively uncontended; it exists because CEF handler objects
//! must be `Send`/`Sync`-safe from Rust's point of view, not to synchronize a
//! real cross-thread producer.
//!
//! ## Coordinates
//!
//! Everything CEF is told (view rect, mouse positions, popup rects) is in
//! **logical** pixels (DIP). The framebuffer it hands back is in **physical**
//! pixels — `logical * device_scale_factor`, rounded by Chromium. The host
//! must therefore size the drawn image by the *reported* frame dimensions, not
//! by its own multiplication.
//!
//! The one exception is [`ImplRenderHandler::screen_point`], which CEF defines
//! as returning **physical** screen coordinates. See [`OsrScreenGeometry`].
